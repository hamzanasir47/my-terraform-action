# terraform-destroy-workspace action

This is one of a suite of Terraform related actions - find them at [dflook/terraform-github-actions](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions).

This action uses the `terraform destroy` command to destroy all resources in a Terraform workspace and then delete the workspace.

## Inputs

* `path`

  Path to the Terraform root module

  - Type: string
  - Optional
  - Default: The action workspace

* `workspace`

  Terraform workspace to destroy and delete

  - Type: string
  - Required

* `variables`

  Variables to set for the terraform destroy. This should be valid Terraform syntax - like a [variable definition file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html#variable-definitions-tfvars-files).

  ```yaml
  with:
    variables: |
      image_id = "${{ secrets.AMI_ID }}"
      availability_zone_names = [
        "us-east-1a",
        "us-west-1c",
      ]
  ```

  Variables set here override any given in `var_file`s.

  - Type: string
  - Optional

* `var_file`

  List of tfvars files to use, one per line.
  Paths should be relative to the GitHub Actions workspace
  
  ```yaml
  with:
    var_file: |
      common.tfvars
      prod.tfvars
  ```

  - Type: string
  - Optional

* `backend_config`

  List of Terraform backend config values, one per line.

  ```yaml
  with:
    backend_config: token=${{ secrets.BACKEND_TOKEN }}
  ```

  - Type: string
  - Optional

* `backend_config_file`

  List of Terraform backend config files to use, one per line.
  Paths should be relative to the GitHub Actions workspace

  ```yaml
  with:
    backend_config_file: prod.backend.tfvars
  ```

  - Type: string
  - Optional

* `parallelism`

  Limit the number of concurrent operations

  - Type: number
  - Optional
  - Default: The terraform default (10)

## Outputs

* `failure-reason`

  When the job outcome is `failure`, this output may be set. The value may be one of:

  - `destroy-failed` - The Terraform destroy operation failed.
  - `state-locked` - The Terraform state lock could not be obtained because it was already locked. 

  If the job fails for any other reason this will not be set.
  This can be used with the Actions expression syntax to conditionally run a steps.

* `lock-info`

  When the job outcome is `failure` and the failure-reason is `state-locked`, this output will be set.

  It is a json object containing any available state lock information and typically has the form:
  ```json
  {
    "ID": "838fbfde-c5cd-297f-84a4-d7578b4a4880",
    "Path": "terraform-github-actions/test-unlock-state",
    "Operation": "OperationTypeApply",
    "Who": "root@e9d43b0c6478",
    "Version": "1.3.7",
    "Created": "2023-01-28 00:16:41.560904373 +0000 UTC",
    "Info": ""
  }
  ```

## Environment Variables

* `GITHUB_DOT_COM_TOKEN`

  This is used to specify a token for GitHub.com when the action is running on a GitHub Enterprise instance.
  This is only used for downloading OpenTofu binaries from GitHub.com.
  If this is not set, an unauthenticated request will be made to GitHub.com to download the binary, which may be rate limited.

  - Type: string
  - Optional

* `TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKENS`

  API tokens for cloud hosts, of the form `<host>=<token>`. Multiple tokens may be specified, one per line.
  These tokens may be used with the `remote` backend and for fetching required modules from the registry.

  e.g:
  ```yaml
  env:
    TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKENS: app.terraform.io=${{ secrets.TF_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
  ```

  With other registries:
  ```yaml
  env:
    TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKENS: |
      app.terraform.io=${{ secrets.TF_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
      terraform.example.com=${{ secrets.TF_REGISTRY_TOKEN }}
  ```

  - Type: string
  - Optional

* `TERRAFORM_SSH_KEY`

  A SSH private key that Terraform will use to fetch git module sources.

  This should be in PEM format.

  For example:
  ```yaml
  env:
    TERRAFORM_SSH_KEY: ${{ secrets.TERRAFORM_SSH_KEY }}
  ```

  - Type: string
  - Optional

* `TERRAFORM_PRE_RUN`

  A set of commands that will be ran prior to `terraform init`. This can be used to customise the environment before running Terraform. 
  
  The runtime environment for these actions is subject to change in minor version releases. If using this environment variable, specify the minor version of the action to use.
  
  The runtime image is currently based on `debian:bullseye`, with the command run using `bash -xeo pipefail`.

  For example:
  ```yaml
  env:
    TERRAFORM_PRE_RUN: |
      # Install latest Azure CLI
      curl -skL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | bash
      
      # Install postgres client
      apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends postgresql-client
  ```

  - Type: string
  - Optional

* `TERRAFORM_HTTP_CREDENTIALS`

  Credentials that will be used for fetching modules sources with `git::http://`, `git::https://`, `http://` & `https://` schemes.

  Credentials have the format `<host>=<username>:<password>`. Multiple credentials may be specified, one per line.

  Each credential is evaluated in order, and the first matching credentials are used. 

  Credentials that are used by git (`git::http://`, `git::https://`) allow a path after the hostname.
  Paths are ignored by `http://` & `https://` schemes.
  For git module sources, a credential matches if each mentioned path segment is an exact match.

  For example:
  ```yaml
  env:
    TERRAFORM_HTTP_CREDENTIALS: |
      example.com=dflook:${{ secrets.HTTPS_PASSWORD }}
      github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions.git=dflook-actions:${{ secrets.ACTIONS_PAT }}
      github.com/dflook=dflook:${{ secrets.DFLOOK_PAT }}
      github.com=graham:${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAT }}  
  ```

  - Type: string
  - Optional

## Example usage

This example deletes the workspace named after the git branch when the associated PR is closed.

```yaml
name: Destroy testing workspace

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  integration:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Cleanup after integration tests
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: terraform destroy
        uses: dflook/terraform-destroy-workspace@v1
        with:
          path: terraform
          workspace: ${{ github.head_ref }}
```

This example retries the terraform destroy operation if it fails.

```yaml
name: Cleanup

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  destroy_workspace:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Destroy Terraform workspace
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: terraform destroy
        uses: dflook/terraform-destroy-workspace@v1
        id: first_try
        continue-on-error: true
        with:
          path: my-terraform-config
          workspace: ${{ github.head_ref }}

      - name: Retry failed destroy
        uses: dflook/terraform-destroy-workspace@v1
        if: ${{ steps.first_try.outputs.failure-reason == 'destroy-failed' }}
        with:
          path: my-terraform-config
          workspace: ${{ github.head_ref }}
```
